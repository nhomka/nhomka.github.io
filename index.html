	<h3>Hi there, I'm Nathan!</h3>
	<p>Read on for some thoughts, or <a href="/about">head over to my About page for now.</a></p>
	<p>While I work on getting this all set up and looking pretty, let me spew out some of the things I'm looking
	to do with this site.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Use it as motivation to finish up the <a href="/currenttasks">things</a> I start and take too long to finish!</li>
		<li>Share some of the many, <em>many</em> lists of random things that I maintain.</li>
		<li>Talk about the projects I'm working on</li>
	</ol>
